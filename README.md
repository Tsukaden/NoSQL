## NoSQL Social Network API

This project is a social network API built using Express.js and MongoDB, with the help of the Mongoose ODM. The API allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to handle large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database.

### Features
